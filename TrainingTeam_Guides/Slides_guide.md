## Suggested File Types
- Presentation slides (PowerPoint, PDF)
- Supplementary instructional materials (Markdown, PDF)
- Speaker notes (Text files)

**Important Note**: It is highly recommended to convert PowerPoint presentations into PDFs before uploading to ensure compatibility and ease of access.

## Best Practices for Naming Conventions
To maintain clarity and consistency in file management, please adhere to the following naming conventions:
- Use descriptive names that reflect the content of the slides (e.g., `seminar_title_topic_overview.pptx`, `seminar_title_topic_notes.txt`).
- Use lowercase letters and separate words with underscores (_) for better readability.
- Include version numbers if applicable (e.g., `seminar_title_topic_v1.0.pdf`).

## Content Overview

Each seminar folder will typically contain:
- **Presentation Slides**: PowerPoint or PDF files used during the seminar.
- **Speaker Notes**: Text files that provide context, details, and additional information related to the presentation slides.
- **Supplementary Materials**: Any additional resources that support the seminar content.

By following these guidelines, we can ensure that all seminar materials are organized and easily accessible for future reference.
