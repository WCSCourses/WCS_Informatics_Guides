This repository is designed to support the **training team** and **course participants** by providing clear and structured documentation for every stage of the course—from preparation to hands-on execution.

## 📂 Guide Categories

We’ve organized our resources into three main categories to support different roles and needs:

## 🧑‍🏫 Training Team Guides

These guides are intended to help instructors and course organizers with **content development, data management, and session planning**. They ensure consistent formatting, smooth integration with virtual tools, and streamlined content delivery.

📘 **Key Guides:**
- [Course Data Guide](https://github.com/WCSCourses/WCS_Informatics_Guides/blob/main/TrainingTeam_Guides/Course_data_guide.md) – Organizing, naming, and uploading datasets and practical materials.
- [Course Module Guide](https://github.com/WCSCourses/WCS_Informatics_Guides/blob/main/TrainingTeam_Guides/Course_modules_guide.md) – Structuring training modules to align with learning outcomes.
- [Presentation Guide](https://github.com/WCSCourses/WCS_Informatics_Guides/blob/main/TrainingTeam_Guides/Slides_guide.md) – Managing session slides, internal vs. shared folders, upload process.

## 👩‍💻 Informatics Installation & Setup Guides

These guides help participants prepare their **local or cloud environments** before the course. Having a consistent and functional environment is essential for smooth participation in practical sessions.

🔧 **Key Guides:**
- [Virtualbox Guide](https://github.com/WCSCourses/WCS_Informatics_Guides/blob/main/Installation_Guides/VM_Guide.md) – Setting up and running VMs for the course.
- [Docker Setup](https://github.com/WCSCourses/WCS_Informatics_Guides/blob/main/Installation_Guides/Docker_guide.md) – Installing Docker and running training containers.
- [Google Colab](https://github.com/WCSCourses/WCS_Informatics_Guides/blob/main/Installation_Guides/Google_Colab.md) – Using Google Colab for exercises without local installation.
- [Linux Learning Resources](https://github.com/WCSCourses/WCS_Informatics_Guides/blob/main/Installation_Guides/linux_learning.md) – Introductory resources for working in Linux environments.

## 🏢 Informatics Facilities Setup Guide

For **in-person courses**, we provide setup requirements for computer labs and hired workstations to ensure participants have the correct environment ready upon arrival.

📘 **Key Guide:**
- [Informatics Facilities Guide](https://github.com/WCSCourses/WCS_Informatics_Guides/blob/main/InformaticsFacilities_Guide/README.md) – Includes lab specs, hybrid setup requirements, power and internet setup, workstation/laptop specs, and more.
