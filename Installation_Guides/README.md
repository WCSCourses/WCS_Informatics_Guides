## üìò Guides Overview

Each guide is tailored to walk you through the steps of setting up your environment, whether you're using a personal machine or a virtual/cloud-based setup. Follow these before the training begins to avoid setup delays during sessions.

### 1. [üíæ VirtualBox Installation Guide](https://github.com/WCSCourses/WCS_Informatics_Guides/blob/main/Installation_Guides/VM_Guide.md)
Learn how to install and run **VirtualBox**, a virtualization tool that allows you to use a full Linux operating system on your Windows or Mac machine. This is helpful for accessing a pre-configured training environment that mirrors what the trainers use.

**What you'll find:**
- Download links for VirtualBox on Intel-chip Mac OS, Linux and Windows
- Step-by-step screenshots for installation
- Downloading the course `.vdi` file from Globus
- How to import `.vdi` virtual machines used in training

### 2. [üê≥ Docker Setup Instructions](https://github.com/WCSCourses/WCS_Informatics_Guides/blob/main/Installation_Guides/Docker_guide.md)
A guide to setting up **Docker**, which allows you to run containerized training environments. This method is faster and more lightweight than a full virtual machine, especially useful for running command-line tools and reproducible analysis pipelines.

**What you'll find:**
- Installation instructions for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- How to pull and run the training Docker image
- Basic Docker commands and troubleshooting tips

---

### 3. [üåê Google Colab Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/WCSCourses/WCS_Informatics_Guides/blob/main/Installation_Guides/Google_Colab.md)
Google Colab allows you to write and execute Python/R code in your browser using Google Drive. It‚Äôs a great option for participants who cannot install software locally or who want to test scripts in a cloud environment.

**What you'll find:**
- How to open and run notebooks on Colab
- Connecting Colab to Google Drive for saving work
- Common issues and how to fix them (e.g., runtime limits)

### 4. [üìö Linux Learning Resources](https://github.com/WCSCourses/WCS_Informatics_Guides/blob/main/Installation_Guides/linux_learning.md)
If you're new to working in Linux environments, we‚Äôve compiled some beginner-friendly resources to help you get comfortable using the command line and basic file operations‚Äîskills essential for many bioinformatics tools.

**Includes:**
- Recommended tutorials and interactive sites
